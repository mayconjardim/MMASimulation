The doctors are not going to allow %a2 continue fighting. Those cuts needs some atention!
The doctor calls off the fight! That cut is too severe for %a1 to continue on. He tries to protest but the fight is over.
%a1 does not look confident about the fight continuing. The doctor grimaces at the severity of the cut and waves the fight off!
I'm not sure this fight can continue with such a severe cut. The doctor wipes the blood away and lifts the towel to examine the gash. Blood oozes out of %a1's cut and that's enough for the doctor to stop the fight!
